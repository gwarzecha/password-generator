# Password Generator

## Purpose
Password Generator is an application that allows a user to generate a random password. This application is especially useful if the user's goal is to create a strong and secure password that cannot be guessed easily. The user can create a password with a length between 8 and 128 characters. The application randomly generates a password using the selected length, comprised of at least one of the following character-types: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or an assortment of special characters. If the user selects an inappropriate length, or fails to choose at least one character type when prompted, they will be prompted to make a valid selection.
